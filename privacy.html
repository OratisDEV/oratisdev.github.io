            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h2>Last updated: 28 January, 2024</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>What information do you collect?</h1>
            Information about Discord objects (guilds, users, channels etc.) may be stored to provide the service or for
            abuse prevention, such as user & guild blacklists. These are usually stored as their unique snowflake
            generated by Discord, allowing SpaceDam to retrieve information about them through Discord's API. All
            information stored on these objects are not end user data and may be excluded from data deletion requests.
            Message content is cached in memory to provide features such as snipe command but is never stored outside of
            this cache unless for debugging purposes. SpaceDam does not store full message content on disk for any
            reason not related to providing the service.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Where is this data stored?</h1>
            Any data collected by SpaceDam is stored in the secure databases located in the server the bot is hosted on
            (OVH). This data is only accessible to the bot owner(s) and the hosting provider.
            Periodic backups of the database are taken as a safety precaution to prevent data loss.
            As for third-party services, we cannot guarantee where the data is stored therefore we are unable to
            guarantee data will not be processed and/or stored in certain locations.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Why is the said data collected?</h1>
            The information received and stored is used in accordance with this privacy policy. This data is solely used
            to provide and improve our services.
            We do not sell or share any data we collect.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>How long is the data stored?</h1>
            All data related to a guild will be deleted permanently upon removal of the bot from the guild. Any data
            cached in memory is either stored until the bot restarts or cleared on regular intervals. You can see how
            long the bot is online for (therefore how long the data has been cached) using the stats command.
            In addition to this:
            Guild administrators have the permission to reset all guild data using the reset command, without needing to
            remove the bot.
            Users can opt out of message content collection by using the snipetoggle command.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Deletion of data</h1>
            You can contact us at our <a href="https://spacedam.xyz/discord.html">Support Server</a> to request deletion of
            your data.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Final Words</h1>
            We may, at any time, and at our sole discretion, update or modify this document with or without prior
            notice, which we may do for reasons that include, but are not limited to, complying with changes to the law
            or reflecting changes to our services. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, your continued use of the Service
            after we post modifications will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to those changes. If you object
            to the changes, you shall stop using our services and can request data removal as outlined above.
